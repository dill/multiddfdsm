Mutli-detection function DSMs
=============================

How do we build density surface models with multiple detection functions in them?

Some theory and code.

To get the code to work you need to use the branch of `dsm` available at: [https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/dsm/tree/multiddf](https://github.com/DistanceDevelopment/dsm/tree/multiddf). You can install it via:

```r
devtools::install_github("DistanceDevelopment/dsm", ref="multiddf")
```
